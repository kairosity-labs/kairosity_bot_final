      "content": "By 2028, **future antitrust interventions affecting compute capacity** are expected to focus on increasing regulatory oversight, data and transparency requirements, and potentially establishing compute-based thresholds to trigger regulatory scrutiny, especially in the context of AI governance and competition law[3][7][5]. Direct interventions restricting access to compute are not currently dominant policy proposals in the US or EU, but the landscape is rapidly evolving and compute capacity is becoming a focal point for potential antitrust and broader regulatory action[7][15].\n\n**Key Context and Supporting Details:**\n\n- **Compute Thresholds for Regulation:** The US and EU have begun to recognize **compute** (especially in the form of \u201ctraining compute\u201d used for AI model development) as a potential triggering metric for regulatory interventions. Regulatory proposals include *training compute thresholds*\u2014specific levels of computational power used in AI development that would trigger added reporting, capability evaluations, and incident monitoring for organizations developing advanced AI[7]. These are seen as ways to clarify which \u201cfrontier\u201d or \u201chigh-risk\u201d systems should be subjected to additional oversight[7].\n\n- **Antitrust Agencies Access to Technical Information:** New rules, especially in the EU\u2019s AI Act, **expand competition agencies' investigative powers**\u2014including access to source code, and potentially detailed information about algorithmic inputs, outputs, and infrastructure usage[3][5]. This increases regulatory insight into how leading firms control and deploy compute, and could support future interventions if evidence of anti-competitive practices arises, such as capacity hoarding or exclusionary conduct.\n\n- **Data Production and Enforcement Capabilities:** Antitrust regulators are preparing to demand unprecedented quantities of information\u2014including data about compute usage, program architectures, and oversight measures\u2014while using computational tools themselves to detect anti-competitive behavior swiftly[5]. This trend is expected to accelerate, with growing expectations on private businesses to rapidly fulfill broad investigative data demands by 2028[5].\n\n- **Legal and Political Constraints:** In the US, emerging legislation underscores that **private ownership and lawful use of computational resources remain protected**, and that government action cannot directly restrict private individuals\u2019 legal use of compute resources[15]. This places a check on direct government intervention to ration or cap compute access, though oversight and transparency obligations may still increase.\n\n- **Competition Policy Implications:** The **AI Act and related regulatory schemes** are changing the foundations and tools of computational antitrust globally, especially in the EU. The expanded procedural powers for agencies and the focus on high-risk AI systems tied to large compute deployments suggest targeted scrutiny rather than broad compute rationing[3].\n\n- **Industry Reactions and Competitive Dynamics:** Rapid innovation and declining inference costs have increased accessibility to advanced AI technologies, reducing barriers to entry and arguably making lock-in via compute hoarding progressively harder to sustain[2]. However, the concentration of leading-edge hardware manufacturing and data center capacity remains a live competition policy concern, especially as strategic sectors (such as cloud providers and chip designers) race to build scale[4][2].\n\n**In summary:**\n- By 2028, antitrust and AI-specific regulatory interventions are likely to hinge on **compute-based thresholds** for reporting and risk assessment, greater data and transparency demands on dominant firms, and enhanced powers for competition authorities to audit technical and infrastructure details[3][7][5].\n- There is no widespread move to outright cap or ration private compute access, but **targeted interventions**\u2014especially at the intersection of AI safety and competition\u2014are expected to increase, driven by both the EU and (to a lesser extent) US federal agencies[7][3][15].\n- The regulatory environment for compute is expected to evolve, with adaptive remedies (such as data-sharing and interoperability mandates) rather than blunt prohibition of compute access, aiming to foster competition while ensuring safety and accountability[6][7][3].",
